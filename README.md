(Currently only works if I run the Server on my PC)

# Setting up you own Server: #

1.) Download the respository.
2.) open cmd in your folder and execute the command: "php server.php"
3.) go into script.js and change "address" in Line 1 to the IP-Adress and Port of your Server
4.) run index.html and start chatting ;)
