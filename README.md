(Currently only works if I run the Server on my PC)

# Setting up your own Server: #

1.) Download the respository.

2.) open cmd in your folder and execute the command: "php server.php"

3.) go into script.js and change "address" in Line 1 to the IP-Adress and Port of your Server

4.) run index.html and start chatting ;)

5.) (If it doesn't work) Try changing the "Protocol" variable in Line 1 from wss to ws
